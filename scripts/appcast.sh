# the newest GitHub release's appcast.xml) so it lists every release. Each item links to the zip in
# its own release (releases/download/vX.Y.Z/), where the release workflow attaches it with the feed.
# Pre-releases stay out of the feed.
#
# The private EdDSA key stays out of the repo: by default Sparkle's tools read it from the login
# Keychain (account "lamina", made by `generate_keys --account lamina`). CI passes
# SPARKLE_KEY_FILE instead, a file holding the exported key (`generate_keys --account lamina -x <file>`).
# Release notes: put Lamina-<version>.html or .md next to the zip in build/appcast and they're
# embedded in the feed.
